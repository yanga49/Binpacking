    "#### Dataset Explanation\n",
    "There are three datasets included in the repository: binpp, binpp-hard, and jburkardt. Binpp and binpp-hard have the same format, they are given as a long text file in which every line is an integer. The first number represents the number of objects that need to be packed, and the second line represents the maximum weight or capacity a bin can hold. Every subsequent line in the file represents the weight of an object that needs to be packed. Let n be the number of objects that need to be packed and let c be the maximum capacity of the bin. In binpp, n = 50, 100, 200, 500 and c = 100, 120, and 150. Binpp-hard has the same formatting, but the values of n = 200 and c = 100000. In the jburkhardt dataset, the file system is arranged a little differently than the binpp one as there are 3 files for every problem. For problems p01, p02, and p03, c = 100 and n ranges from 9 to 14. For problem p04, c = 524 and n = 33. For each problem, the file ending with c contains the capacity number and the file ending with w contains the weights of the objects that need to be packed. The s file contains an assignment of weights. The values of the n parameter are important to evaluate algorithm performance, as the time complexity of the problem is in terms of n. The longer n is, the longer the algorithm will take to find the number of bins needed to optimally pack the n items.\n",

    "- Single responsibility\n",
    "The separation of online and offline algorithms implements the single responsibility principle, as all Online and Offline algorithms will be separated into their respective files.\n",
    "Each implementation of a bin packing algorithm is given its own class with its own functions it will use to perform bin packing. By separating each algorithm into its own class with its own functions, the single responsibility principle is followed.\n",
    "- Open closed\n",
    "The use of a BinPacker interface for the bin packing algorithms as well as the separation of Online and Offline algorithms uses the open-closed principle. The program is open to extension of new algorithm classes, but it is closed to modification as BinPacker, Online, and Offline need not be modified in order to accommodate for the addition of algorithms.\n",
    "- Interface segregation\n",
    "Interface segregation was used by the implementation of the BinPacker interface. This interface separates Online and Offline bin packing algorithms, allowing the user to access any of the Online or Offline implementations easily.\n",
    "- Dependency injection\n",
    "The details of each bin packing algorithm implementation are unimportant to the user, and thus, the user does not need to be made aware of the internal functions that are ‘injected’ in each algorithm class. Only the _process() function of each algorithm matters, which is why this design implants dependency injection.\n",

    "- Next Fit\n",
    "This is the simplest approximate approach to the bin packing problem. This is an online algorithm in which the first item is assigned to the first bin. The weight stream is then considered by increasing indexes. If an item fits in the current bin, it is assigned to that bin. Otherwise, the next bin becomes the current one. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), as the algorithm only traverses the weight stream once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next Fit Decreasing\n",
    "This is an offline algorithm in which the weights are sorted first into decreasing order. Then, the Next Fit algorithm is applied as discussed above. The time complexity of the algorithm would be O(n + nlogn) which approximates to O(nlogn) since it will take O(nlogn) time to sort the list of weights first using timsort (Python’s default sorting algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "- First Fit \n",
    "This is an online algorithm which considers the weight stream according to increasing indices. It assigns each item to the lowest indexed initialized bin into which it fits. When the current item cannot fit into any of the previous initialized bins, a new bin is introduced and the item is assigned to that bin. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n2), because it has to traverse the weight stream, but also has to loop through previous bins if needed. However, this time complexity can be reduced to O(nlogn) if a self balancing binary tree is used as the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First Fit Decreasing\n",
    "This is an offline algorithm in which the weights are sorted first into decreasing order. Then, the First Fit algorithm is applied as discussed above. The time complexity of the algorithm would be O(n2 + nlogn) which approximates to O(n2) since it will take O(nlogn) time to sort the list of weights first using timsort (Python’s default sorting algorithm). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Best Fit\n",
    "This is an online algorithm which considers the weight stream according to increasing indices. It  assigns each item to the feasible bin having the smallest space left but can still fit the item. Essentially, it will place each item in the tightest spot. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n2), because it has to traverse the weight stream, but also has to loop through previous bins if needed in order to determine the tightest spot.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Worst Fit\n",
    "This is an online algorithm which considers the weight stream according to increasing indices. It assigns each item to the feasible bin having the most empty space. Essentially, it will place the item in the least tightest spot to even out the bins. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n2), because it has to traverse the weight stream, but also has to loop through previous bins if needed in order to determine the least tight spot.\n",
